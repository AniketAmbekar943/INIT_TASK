**Short Note About My Reflection:-** This paper showed how using deep learning with large datasets can greatly improve image classification. I found it interesting how techniques like ReLU, dropout, and GPU training helped achieve such good results. It also made me realize the challenges, like needing powerful computers and lots of data, and inspired me to look for simpler and faster models like MobileNet that can work on limited resources.
