# INIT_TASK
Name:- Aniket G. Ambekar
Summary:- This task involved three csv_files(customer, products, transaction data) wich were the datasest to work on. I successfully loaded the datasest, cleaned them, handled Missing numeric and categorical data and then, calculated some essential key metrics(revenue, profit_margin,etc.) and merged them together using Left Join(No Data Loss). Later I did some analysis using the aggregate functions for Customer Metrics, Time-Based Analysis, Product Performance and Customer Segmentation (RFM). After that I performed some advance Operations and identified Suspicious Transactions, Calculated 7-day Moving Average of daily revenue using Rolling Window Analysis with properly handling edge cases, and also did some Feature Engineering related to certain thing in the merged Dataframe. Lastly, I wrote some Optimized code for a loop and made it vectorized and also wrote a code for a reusable function. Overall, this task demonstrated my ability to clean, analyze, and draw insights from data using Python’s core data-science tools.
Tools used:- Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
Dependencies/Libraries used:- Python 3.9+(Core Programming Language), Numpy(for Numerical and Mathematical Operations), Pandas(for Data loading, cleaning, handling missing vlues,etc.), time(for benchmarking performance measurements)
